## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference

Feature that was not part of the challenge was the second screen showing calculations history. 
As a patter for testing functionallity I used built-in Windows calculator.

## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS BEM methodology
- SASS

### What I learned

In this project I mainly used grid for positioning elements. 
For theme-switch button I used CSS variables (I couldn't quite get it right with SASS variables).
I tried to use BEM for naming classes and I think it worked out really well.

### Continued development

This is my first solo project with Javascript and I'm very happy with how it turned out. I added a little extra from myself besides the challenge I was provided (second screen and timer on auto-resetting the calculator).
For future project I would like to dive deeper into SASS functionality, I think there is more to it than I used here. Of course keeping JS code cleanier than here would be my goal for all future projects.
